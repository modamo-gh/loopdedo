loopdedo is a task management app that allows a user to cycle through tasks. In my daily life, I find myself trying or wanting to get various things done: making time to read, chores, finding time to program, etc. I'd prefer to spend an equal amount of time on everything (making adjustments depending on the task) and pick up where I left off the next day. So, why try to keep track of that in my head when I could use loopdedo?
